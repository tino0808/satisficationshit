# The Useless Stress Ball Splash üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TDI


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Tino Paul. - ICCS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
- Member 1: Henil Das C.Y - ICCS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT

### Project Description
This ‚ÄúStress Ball Splash‚Äù is a pointless yet oddly satisfying browser game where a yellow stress ball sits in the middle of the screen.
Move your mouse over it, and it bursts with animated water droplets under gravity while playing a splash sound.
It‚Äôs completely useless‚Ä¶ but strangely addictive.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In real life, stress balls don‚Äôt violently spray water when touched, which means this project solves an entirely imaginary crisis ‚Äî the global shortage of aquatic stress relief.
It addresses the completely fictional need for a ball that turns every poke into a mini water park.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ntroduce the Stress Ball Splash Simulator ‚Äî a purely digital invention that fulfills the non-existent demand for watery stress relief without flooding your desk.
By combining a harmless yellow ball, over-the-top splash physics, and a satisfying sound effect, it delivers all the joy of splashing water‚Ä¶ with none of the mop work.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML,CSS,JS
- No external frameworks are used.
- None-all animations, physics, and rendering are done using the native HTML5 <canvas> API.
- Web Browser ‚Äì to run and test the game
  HTML5 Canvas API ‚Äì for drawing and animating shapes.
  Audio API (via <audio> tag) ‚Äì for playing the splash sound effect.

For Hardware:
- None
